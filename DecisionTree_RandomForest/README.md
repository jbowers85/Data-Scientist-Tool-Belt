# Decision Tree & Random Forest

This repository is meant to provide an example of implementing a decision tree and a random forest in R.  We will predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic! These predictions can even be uploaded to Kaggle to compete in the Titanic Machine Learning challenge.

**Decision Tree**: A series of "if this, then that" statements which leads to a final prediction. 

**Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that use a random subset of features for each tree. The collection of decision trees vote on the final prediction.

## Getting Started

Save the 2 files, "Titanic_train.csv" and "Titanic_test.csv" to your working directory to follow along.

If using this code within R Studio, collapse all sections by pressing Alt + O for easier navigation between sections.
